Velcome to Group 3`s group project!

The DATA folder contains an exam_dataset.txt that was very untidy, we therefore tidyed it up using the "Tidy_Data_Main_script.R" resulting in a new dataset "tidy_exam_dataset.txt"

The SCRIPTS folder contains all the scripts we have used, and is named according to the task they were used for.The scripts starting with "01_..." is just test-scripts and can be disregarded.
