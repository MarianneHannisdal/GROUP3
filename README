Velcome to Group 3`s group project! The group consists of Siren Hovland, Hildegunn Fr√∏nningen, Marianne Hannisdal 

The DATA folder contains an exam_dataset.txt that was very untidy, we therefore tidyed it up using the "Tidy_Data_Main_script.R" resulting in a new dataset "tidy_exam_dataset.txt". It also contains the codebook describing the data we have used.

The SCRIPTS folder contains all the scripts we have used, and is named according to the task they were used for.The scripts is named with "01_..." to define the chronological order.

The RESULTS folder contains all the relevant plots we made to answer the exam questions, and the actual results in the file "Final_report.rmd""
